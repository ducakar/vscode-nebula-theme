# Nebula Theme for VS Code
ðŸŒŒðŸŒ¸Fresh colors on a dark, cold slate. An almost-material theme for Visual Studio Code.

## Activation

After installation or update, you can click the "Activate" button on the notification pop-up to immediately set Nebula as the workbench color theme.

## Credits

The configurability of this theme was made possibly thanks to Philipp Kief's generous licensing of the source code to his wonderful [Material Icon Theme](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=PKief.material-icon-theme). I highly recommend installing it alongside Nebula, using a folder color of `#CDF6FE`.
