## Contributing

Please say everything you hate about me and this theme [here](https://github.com/eating-coleslaw/vscode-nebula-theme/issues). I'm only familiar with a handful of languages, so if your gripe is language-specific please include the relevant [scope selectors](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/extensions/themes-snippets-colorizers#_textmate-theme-rules) in the issue.
